# TODO

# convert fpl_myteam_get() to class player_mysquad - done
# convert get_opponents_squad() to class opponent_pub_view - done

# arg[dbload] - now does nothing since main() is now 100% class/method when I rebulit v2.0 & python3

# cookies:
# I am not a low-level web browser guru. So I've hacked some code arround userid cookies. It hard-coded & not flexible for general users.
# I've reverse engineered and extract cookies from my browers for my testing game userids & hard-coded them into the code.
# I currrently don't know how to decode and extract a users cookie on the fly in realtime for any user and insert it into the
# API extract process. This needs to be fixed as it will result in data access failure & incorrect data being extracted
# for any game user other than me & my tetsing userids/cookies.

# API endpoint : bootstrap-dynamic
# this is a ver small & simple API endpoint JSON dataset and might be easier to leverage
# as an API endpoint for initial userid cookie decode hacking
